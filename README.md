# Modeling NYC Apartment Rental Pricing on Craigslist

by Austin Poor

I did this analysis as my second project for the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps). For this project we chose our own topics but were required to use gather our data by web-scraping and use a linear regression model.

As a New Yorker, I chose to model New York City apartment rental prices, using data scraped from Craigslist.

Data was collected from NYC area Craigslist ([newyork.craigslist.com](https://newyork.craigslist.com/search/apa)) with listings that were posted in the range `2019-12-24` to `2020-01-23`.
